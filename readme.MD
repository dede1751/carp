Carp is a UCI-compatible didactic engine written in Rust, using a bitboard-based piece-centric approach.\
The engine is built on top of a conventional Negamax search and uses a simple NNUE evaluation.

The main goal of this project is to learn the basics of both Rust and Chess Programming.

## Building Carp

For development, Carp should be built through Cargo with ```cargo run --release```. Additionally, the **Tools**
module can be conditionally compiled with the flag ```--features tools```. All external dependencies are
limited to this feature.

To compile Carp for maximum performance, the use of [PGO][pgo-link] is highly recommended. Depending on the CPU,
it has shown to be up to 60 elo over a standard Cargo build. To do this, either run ```make native``` to only
build an executable targeting the machine's specific architecture, or build all available [microarchitecture
levels][arch-link] for the running OS through ```make release```.

**NOTE**: the PGO build requires having *llvm-profdata*, which should be included with LLVM or CLANG.


## Performance

Move generation is fully legal, inspired by [this article][movegen-link]
and perft(8) on startpos will achieve ~340 MNodes/s on a 7950x.

Newer versions added much more aggressive pruning techniques, which have brought a noticeable speedup in
time to depth and reduced the branching factor greatly. During search, Carp will usually run at ~2MNodes/s on a single
core (up to 3.8MN/s with PGO).

Carp is rigorously tested with SPRT, and has recently joined the [Engine Programming OB instance][ob-link].

## NNUE

Carp uses a 768->(768x2)->1 perspective net trained with MarlinFlow.
It fully relies on its own self-play data for training the network. Data can be generated with the
utilities provided in the Tools module, which can be conditionally compiled by passing the tools 
feature to Cargo.

As of Carp 2.0, NNUE has compltely replaced the old HCE.

## Implemented optimizations

* Fully legal move generation with Fixed Shift Black Magic Bitboards
* Fail-Hard Negamax + Quiescence
* Iterative Deepening with Aspiration Windows
* Move Ordering with a staged sorter:
  - MVV-LVA with Threshold Static Exchange Evaluation
  - Killers
  - History / Counter Move History / Followup History
* Multithreading with Lazy-SMP
* Lockless Transposition table with newest + highest depth replacement scheme
* Principal Variation Search
* Internal Iterative Reductions
* Late Move Reductions
* Null Move Pruning
* Reverse Futility Pruning
* Mate Distance Pruning
* History Leaf Pruning
* Extended Futility Pruning
* Late Move Pruning
* Singular Extensions

## Dependencies
None of these are necessary to run the engine, but they are vital for development:
